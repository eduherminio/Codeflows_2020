Say that a string is binary if it consists solely of the symbols 0 and 1 (the empty string is binary too). For a binary string s let's define two functions:

The function rev(s) reverses the string s. For example, rev(010111)=111010 and rev(01)=10.
The string flip(s) changes each character in s from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. For example, flip(010111)=101000 and flip(11)=00.
If s=rev(s) then we say that s is a palindrome. If s=rev(flip(s)) then we say that s is an antipalindrome.

Given a binary string s=s1s2…s|s|, divide it into a palindrome and an antipalindrome. Formally, you should find two sequences i1,i2,…,ik and j1,j2,…,jm, such that:

k,m≥0
|s|=k+m
All indices i1,i2,…,ik,j1,j2,…,jm are distinct integers satisfying 1≤ix,jx≤|s|.
i1<i2<…<ik and j1<j2<…<jm
The string si1si2…sik is a palindrome.
The string sj1sj2…sjm is an antipalindrome.
Input:
The first line contains a single integer, t - the number of test cases. The next t lines describe test cases.

The only line for each test case contains a binary string s.

Output:
In the first line for each test case, print two integers k and m.

In the second line for each test case, print k integers i1,i2,…,ik.

In the third line for each test case, print m integers j1,j2,…,jm.

All required conditions should be satisfied.

It can be shown that an answer always exists. If there exist multiple answers you can print any.

Explanation:
In the first test case, the string 0 is a palindrome and the empty string is an antipalindrome.

In the second test case, we can use indices [1,4,6,8,11] to create the palindrome s1s4s6s8s11=11011 and indices [2,3,5,7,9,10] to create the antipalindrome s2s3s5s7s9s10=011001.
