Chefina loves cakes! N suitors numbered 1…N have arrived from across the seven seas to woo her.

Each of the suitors wishes to impress Chefina, so suitor i has prepared a cake of height Hi. To test the suitors, Chefina assigned them Q tasks. Each of the tasks is of one of the following types:

1 L R X: Increase the heights of all cakes in the range L to R inclusive by X, i.e., increase each of HL, HL+1, HL+2… HR by X.
2: Find the sum of heights of all cakes prepared by odd-numbered suitors.
3: Find the sum of heights of all cakes prepared by even-numbered suitors.
Can you help the suitors complete the tasks?

Input:
The first line contains an integer N, the number of cakes.
The next line contains N space-separated integers H1,H2,…,HN, denoting the heights of the cakes.
The third line contains an integer Q, the number of tasks.
The next Q lines describe the tasks assigned to the suitors by Chefina.
Output:
For each task of type 2 or 3, display the sum of heights of all cakes prepared by odd or even-numbered suitors, respectively, on a new line.

Constraints:
1≤N≤105
1≤Q≤2⋅105
1≤L≤R≤N
1≤X,Hi≤108
Subtasks:
Subtask #1 (10% of the score): 1≤N,Q,X,Hi≤103.
Subtask #2 (10% of the score): 1≤N,Q≤103.
Subtask #3 (80% of the score): Original constraints.
Sample Input:

Sample Output:
8
19
21
12
Explanation:
Initially,

The sum of heights of cakes prepared by odd-numbered suitors is 2+5+1=8.
The sum of heights of cakes prepared by even-numbered suitors is 9+2+8=19.
After increasing the heights of cakes prepared by suitors 1, 2 and 3,

The sum of heights of cakes prepared by odd-numbered suitors becomes 4+7+1=12.
The sum of heights of cakes prepared by even-numbered suitors becomes 11+2+8=21.
