Given an array A1,A2,…,AN, calling the function calculate_or(i) (described by the C++ code below) will return the bitwise OR of Ai,Ai+1,…,AN, albeit quite inefficiently.

int calculate_or (int i) {
    if (i == N) return A[i];
    if (calculate_or(i+1) == A[i]) return A[i];
    return calculate_or(i+1) | A[i];
}
In particular, calling calculate_or(1) will return the bitwise OR of the entire array. Your job is to permute the array A such that calling calculate_or(1) results in the least possible total number of calls to calculate_or(i), and then output this number.

Input:
The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines of input in the following form:

N
A1,A2,....,AN
Output:
For each testcase, output on a new line the least possible total number of calls to calculate_or(i) when calculate_or(1) is called over all permutations of the array A.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤60
1≤Ai≤106
It is guaranteed that the sum of the maximum element in the array over all testcases doesn't exceed 5×106

Sample Input:
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 3 3 7
Sample Output:
4
9
EXPLANATION:
Sample case 1: If we leave A unchanged, then the function calculate_or(i) is called 7 times:

1 time with i=1
2 times with i=2
4 times with i=3
If we permute A such that it becomes [3,1,2], then the function is called 4 times:

1 time with i=1
1 time with i=2
2 times with i=3
Since 4 is the least possible number that can be achieved, it is the answer.

Sample case 2: If we leave A unchanged, then the function calculate_or(i) is called 15 times:

1 time with i=1
2 times with i=2
4 times with i=3
8 times with i=4
If we permute A such that it becomes [7,3,1,3], then the function is called 9 times:

1 time with i=1
2 times with i=2
2 times with i=3
4 times with i=4
Since 9 is the least possible number that can be achieved, it is the answer.
